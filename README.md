Events Calendar with Simple Calendar, Turbo, and Stimulus
This Rails 7 project integrates an interactive calendar that highlights upcoming events using the simple_calendar gem. When a date is selected, a timeline of events for that date is displayed dynamically, without reloading the entire page. Turbo and Stimulus are used to enhance the user experience by making the selected date active and updating content in real-time.

Dynamic Event Loading: Selecting a date dynamically loads a timeline of events for that day without refreshing the page, powered by Turbo.
Active Date Highlighting: The selected date is visually highlighted using Stimulus, enhancing navigation within the calendar.
